#### Ingredients
* 2 eggs

* 1 onion sliced
* 1/4 cup grated light cheese
* 1 tbsp bacon crumbs
* dash of salt/pepper

#### Directions
1. Spray and heat up a frying pan on the stove on medium. Slice your onions, you want them to be thick pieces so they will hold the egg mixture.
2. In a small bowl mix all of your ingredients.
3. Place your rings in the hot pan and carefully pour your egg mixture into the rings. Fill almost to the top but not quite to avoid over flowing. Cover with a lid and cook until the eggs are done. The lid will help cook the egg all around since you wont be flipping them.
