* 24-32 ounces fresh cranberries
* 1-2 cups high-quality orange juice (combines the old recipe components for water + sugar)
  * orange juice concentrate works well
  * honey works well for added sweetening

  * add raw sugar if you must
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
