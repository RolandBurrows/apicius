### Skyrim Soup

**Prep:** Moderate<br>
**Cook:** 40 min<br>
**Serves:** 6 Wood Elves or 4 Nords or 2 Orcs or 1 Giant<br>

#### Ingredients
Primary:
* 4 generous cups roughly chopped red cabbage
* 2 firm, tart red cooking apples, unpeeled (Braeburn, etc.)
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1 large leek, finely chopped
* 2 shallots, finely diced
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 6 cups beef broth
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 tsp dried marjoram
* 4-6 springs fresh thyme or 2 tsp dried thyme
* Abundant freshly ground black pepper and sea salt to taste

Optional:
* 1⁄4 cup red wine
* 2 tbsp raw unfiltered honey
* 6 Sausages (grilled and sliced)
* 1⁄4 cup pearled barley (boil 2 cups water, add barley, cook like rice. Makes 1 cup cooked barley.)

#### Directions
1. Slice cabbage into 1 inch wide pieces. Core the apples amd then chop into 1/2 inch cubes.
2. In a 2 quart soup pot preheat the oil over medium heat, then stir in the leek, shallots and garlic. Saute for 5 minutes or until the vegetables are softened. Fry for another 2 minutes, then add the broth, bay leaves, marjoram, salt and cabbage. Add dried thyme or fresh thyme sprigs.
3. Increase the heat to high and bring to an active simmer for 3 minutes, then turn the heat down to medium-low. Partially cover and simmer the soup for 15 minutes or until cabbage is tender.
4. Stir in the apples and optional ingredients, partially cover and simmer another 8 to 12 minutes or until the apples are tender (simmer more for firmer apples, less for very soft, tender pieces). Turn off the heat. Rest the soup for about 10 minutes, uncover and taste the broth; adjust the seasonings with more black pepper and salt as needed.
5. Serve the soup hot ladled into wide bowls, and if desired top with a spoonful of plain yogurt and a sprinkle of chopped fresh dill.
