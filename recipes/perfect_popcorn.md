### Perfect Popcorn
(Recipe courtesy of Alton Brown, 2006)

**Prep:** Easy, but requires direct heat (gas range, firepit, etc.)<br>
**Cook:** 3 min<br>
**Creates:** 1 giant bowl<br>

#### Ingredients
* 3 tbsp coconut oil
* 1/2 cup yellow popcorn kernels
* 1/2 teaspoon popcorn salt

Optional Toppings:
* 1 package of boxed mac-n-cheese cheese powder

#### Directions
1. Place the oil, popcorn, and salt in a large metal mixing bowl. Cover with heavy-duty aluminum foil and poke 10 slits in the top with a knife.
2. Place the bowl over medium direct heat and shake constantly using two pairs of tongs to shake the bowl. Continue shaking until the popcorn finishes popping, approximately 3 minutes.
3. Remove the bowl from the heat and carefully remove the foil. Stir in any salt that is on the side of the bowl.
4. Add optional topping(s), allow bowl to cool (or transfer to a new bowl), and serve.
