### Zoltan's Famous Langos

#### Ingredients:

    Potato (I make instant mashed potatoes, a serving for two people)
    1 packet of yeast
    1 teaspoon sugar
    1 3/4 cups hungarian flour. (take this with a grain of salt, you may need more depending on how much water content you have in the instant mashed potatoes.)
    1 tablespoon sunflower oil.
    3/4 teaspoon salt.
    1/2 cup milk.
    2 cloves garlic, pealed
    
#### Directions:

#####  Dough
    - Place warm mashed potatoes, yeast, sugar, flour, oil, salt, and milk into a medium mixing bowl.
    - Mix ingredients until well moistened. You may need to add a bit more flour here.
    - knead dough for 5 to 7 minutes.
    - use a stick of butter to grease a bowl, and place dough in the bowl. Allow the dough to rise for about an hour, or until the dough doubles in size.
    - cut dough into four sections and ball the dough up.
    - If you plan to fry this later, use some sunflower oil to grease up a cookie sheet, place dough balls on cookie sheet, cover with plastic wrap and place in fridge
#####  Fry
    - place a boat load of sunflower oil in a pan
    - Heat the oil to about 350 degrees.
    - flatten out a dough ball using a flowered surface, more or less think about making it a pizza crust.
    - place dough in hot oil and cook each side for 1 or 2 minutes, it will turn a nice golden brown letting you know it's done.
    - place fried dough on paper towels to help drain unessesary oil.
    - apply a light coat of salt and rub the garlic clove into the dough
    - repeat steps 3 - 6 until you are out of dough balls.
