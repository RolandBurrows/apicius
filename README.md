## Novus Apicius

"The New Recipes" - Inspired by the name for [a collection of Roman cookery recipes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apicius).

> The name "Apicius" (aa-pish-us) had long been associated with excessively refined love of food,
> from the habits of an early bearer of the name, Marcus Gavius Apicius, a Roman 
> gourmet and lover of refined luxury who lived sometime in the 1st century CE, 
> during the reign of Tiberius.

#### The Goal
* To store and track the evolution of mah favorite recipes

#### Why a code repository?
* I wasn't satisfied with other online recipe storage offerings, or merely storing docs on some server. But at its heart, git is a version control system. Which means that I get the best of online storage, flexible markdown presentation, and historical tracking.  Win-win-win.
