### Posole pressure cooker

### Mise en Place:

* 2 pounds country pork ribs 
* Kosher salt and fresh cracked pepper
* 1 tbsp olive oil, divided
* 1 white onion, chopped
* 4 garlic cloves, minced
* 2 tablespoons chili powder
* 4 cups low sodium chicken broth
* 2 cups water
* 2 (15 oz) cans hominy, drained and rinsed
* 4 oz diced avocado and lime wedges, for serving
* Green cabbage sliced thin
* cilantro for garnish


### Directions:

1.Season the pork ribs with salt, pepper, chili powder, lime, and a drizzle of olive oil.. let sit till ribs are room temp - the lime will break down the ribs and allow the seasoning to get inside.

2. Fire up the grill (gas or charcoal) to about a 5-6 second heat test / medium heat.. grill the ribs 5-6 mins a side to get nice markings

3. Let the ribs rest 

4. Add oil, onion, garlic, and chili powder and saut√© until soft. Add broth and water, cook, stirring and scraping up browned bits with a wooden spoon. Cut the ribs in half and add to the pressure cooker.

5. Secure lid. Bring to high pressure over medium-high heat; reduce heat to maintain pressure and cook until meat is tender - 45 minutes. Remove from heat, vent pressure, then remove lid. Skim fat if any.

6. Using two forks, shred pork; then stir in hominy and heat through.

7. Serve with avocado, cabbage and lime and garnish with cilantro.
