### History

_The Natural History_ - Pliny the Elder <br>
Book 18: The Natural History of Grain <br>
Chpt 26: The Various Kinds of Leaven <br>

>It is generally thought that this is the best method of making bread.
>
>In most cases they do not warm the leaven at all, but only make use of a little of the dough that has been kept from the day before.
>
>It is very evident that the principle which causes the dough to rise is of an acid nature, and it is equally evident that those persons who are dieted upon fermented bread are stronger in body.


### Leaven Care Instructions

**Vivian-Family Start Culture**

Prep:
1. Store culture in a glass jar (instead of plastic, which would break down over time and leech into the culture).
1. Once per week (usually on Bread-Making Day):
   1. Remove culture jar from fridge and mix together in a fresh mixing bowl:
      - 1 part (e.g. 60g) whole wheat flour
      - 1 part (e.g. 60g) primary bread-making flour (bread, all-purpose, etc.)
      - 2 parts (e.g 120g) pure spring water (not tap water)
   1. Once thoroughly combined, scoop mixture into culture's jar and then thoroughly combine with pre-existing culture mass.
   1. Seal jar and leave at room temperature for 2-3 hrs.
   1. Burp the jar (open lid to release built-up gases) to confirm culture activity.
   1. Place back in fridge until next week.
1. Burp sealed jar periodically, if desired.
