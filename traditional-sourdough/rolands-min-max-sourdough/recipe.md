### Roland's Min/Max Sourdough

So named, because the goal is minimum effort for maximum value. <br>
A secondary goal is to make the bread edible for people with gluten-intolerance, such as Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (yes, this is possible).

Note: this recipe is specifically adapted for Colorado. Alteration will be required for other locales.
