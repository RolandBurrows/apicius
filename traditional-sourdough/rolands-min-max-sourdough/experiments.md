## Vivian-Family Starter Culture - Experiments

Note to self: always keep the primary Culture storage jar fed the same, week over week. If introducing a new flour combination, get a new jar instead of contaminating the original batch.

#### Experiment 002

[Bread flour only](https://github.com/RolandBurrows/novus-apicius/blob/54c3714b525d9c32beb247219c390709ba383ab7/traditional-sourdough/rolands-min-max-sourdough/recipe.md) - Results: much fluffier, great sour flavor, addicting for wife (hasn't eaten bread in years).

#### Experiment 001

[Tartine Prototype](https://github.com/RolandBurrows/novus-apicius/blob/75802bf5888379a5ac3eb6140169897d2e8d2dc4/traditional-sourdough/rolands-min-max-sourdough/recipe.md) - Results: core is too underdone, shape is too flat, definitely sourdough flavor. We're on to something, here.
