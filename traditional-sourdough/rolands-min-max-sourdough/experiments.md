## Vivian-Family Starter Culture - Experiments

Note to self: always keep the primary Culture storage jar fed the same, week over week. If introducing a new flour combination, get a new jar instead of contaminating the original batch.

### Experiments Summary

[Experiment 003](#experiment-003) - Mini-loaves <br>
[Experiment 002](#experiment-002) - Bread flour only <br>
[Experiment 001](#experiment-001) - Tartine style (bread flour + whole wheat flour) <br>

#### Experiment 003

Mini loaves. Modify core recipe, but use:
   - 600g flour
   - 472g water
   - 15g salt
   - multiple mini loaf pan (8 molds)

Results:
   - Without lid of dutch oven, top crust dries out too quickly and forms hard shell, preventing rise. Scoring didn't help.
   - Cuteness of mini loaves isn't worth the overly solid crust.

#### Experiment 002

[Bread flour only](https://github.com/RolandBurrows/novus-apicius/blob/54c3714b525d9c32beb247219c390709ba383ab7/traditional-sourdough/rolands-min-max-sourdough/recipe.md) - Results: much fluffier, great sour flavor, addicting for wife (hasn't eaten bread in years).

#### Experiment 001

[Tartine Prototype](https://github.com/RolandBurrows/novus-apicius/blob/75802bf5888379a5ac3eb6140169897d2e8d2dc4/traditional-sourdough/rolands-min-max-sourdough/recipe.md) - Results: core underdone, shape too flat, but definitely sour flavor. We're on to something, here.
